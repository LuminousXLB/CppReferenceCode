# CppReferenceCode

This repo is designed to be synchronized with the gist https://gist.github.com/LuminousXLB/d43f80fba9d765544787bc6c4c6e684f.

It is like this because the poor GitBook cannot embed code blocks in other ways.

Due to the limitation of Github Gist, only files located at the root of thie repository will be syncronized.
